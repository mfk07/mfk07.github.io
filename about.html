			<p class="about-copy">Welcome! I am Maria and am venturing into the world of full-stack web development. After 15 years of working in Education and Children's Services, I decided I wanted a better work/life balance and my journey into web development began. I joined the iO Academy Full-Stack Track in July 2022 and have been building up my portfolio through weekly tasks and challenges.
				<br>
				<br>
				I hail from Australia and have been living in the UK for the last 10 years, most of those spent in the South-East. I have a 1-year-old daughter who keeps me on my toes, and two cats (who think they are human!), Einstein and Archimedes. It's hard to tell who rules the roost these days!
